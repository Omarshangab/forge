Welvome to Forge.

Now this mobile app is gonna be used for tracking habits, ive noticed that when i want to stay consistent with an action or task im more successful at it when i can visual see a streak. 

for example i used to never work out consistently, then i downloaded this mobile app call ladder, it has this function where you have to do 3 workouts in a week in order for it to count to your weekly streak, noce you complete a workout one of the 3 bars gets filled out showing how much more workouts you have left for the week so you can get that week streak number to increase by one. this gave me a huge sense of progress every day i worked out because you cant tell the progress on your body quite yet but seeing that bar getting filled out bringing you that much closer to the goal of 3 workouts a week is very fullfiling. and then once you've completed those 3 workouts it increased your weekly streak and every time you log on to the app you can see it. so far because of this app i have worked out 3 day every week for the last 42 weeks and im happy everytime i look in the mirror.

that was an example but it goes to show me how powerful tracking your habits counts are. thus the reason i want to build forge.

Now as far as project ive already built out my styling with tailwindcss. but if we need a backend lets use firebase, as its the one im most familiar with.

Alright for the coldblitz section, let me tell you what it is first. its basically a challenge that you do a certain habit for 21 days straight. and at the end of the 21 days if you complete it you get a reward that you choosed at the begin of the challenge. on of the biggest thing is the ability to see that daily streak go up and gain a sense of progress. i want you to recreate this better than how i described but withh the same underlying principle. if you need to use a backend let me know so we can set up firebase.

We’ll use javascript for language, react/next.js. and I’ll be using Vercel to host. 

Lets also use tailswindcss and daisyus for styling.
